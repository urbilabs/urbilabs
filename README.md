# Urbi Labs // Mateusz Urbanek

Building, breaking, and benchmarking systems. By day, I build AI-native apps; by night, I’m digging into the plumbing that makes distributed systems actually stay up. 

**Urbi Labs** is my personal scratchpad for the stuff that doesn't make it into a Jira ticket: raw benchmarks, failed experiments, and "un-vibecoded" implementations.

### 💼 The Day Job
* **Orange Polska** // Fullstack Engineer — Scaling internal platforms, AI integrations, and cross-platform native apps.
* **Aexol** // Backend Developer — 3 years of deep-diving into API architecture, microservices, and system logic.
* **Deloitte** // Salesforce Intern — Where the first commit happened (2021).

### 🧪 What I'm poking at
* **Distributed State:** Building and breaking load balancers, proxies, and consensus logic.
* **Performance:** Moving from "it works" to "it's efficient"—optimizing Node.js event loops and Python execution.
* **Real-time Systems:** Exploring high-concurrency event streams and low-latency data. This includes everything from betting bots and strategy analyzers to AI-based FPS aim assist integrated with hardware.

### 🛠 The Stack
* **Primary:** TypeScript (Node.js/Next.js), Python (AI/Automation)
* **Mobile:** React Native
* **Data:** Postgres/Mongo for the truth, Redis for the speed.
* **Infra:** Docker/Kubernetes, Linux internals, and a lot of `curl` commands.

### 📂 Projects

* **[asset-tracker](https://github.com/urbilabs/asset-tracker) // Real-time Data Pipes** A cross-market ingestion engine focused on the architectural challenge of normalizing high-frequency WebSockets (Stocks/Crypto) and asynchronous API state (Banking) into a unified query layer.

* **[scaling-sandbox](https://github.com/urbilabs/scaling-sandbox) // Chaos Lab** A local playground using containerized nodes to simulate what happens to a system when the load balancer dies or the network gets flaky.

* **[urbilabs-platform](https://github.com/urbilabs/urbilabs-platform)** A custom-built engine (Next.js) to host my deep-dives into system design, infra, and whatever I learned the hard way this week.
